E-commerce websites like **`Amazon`**, **`Flipkart`** uses different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.

Amazon product reviews dataset for this project contains ratings of different electronic products although it does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.

- Performed Descriptive and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Built baseline recommendation system to recommend products to customers.
  - `Rank-Based` Recommendation System Model.
  - `Similarity Based` Collaborative Filtering Model.
  - `Matrix Factorization Based` Collaborative Filtering Model using `SVD`.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `user-user Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `item-item Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `Matrix Factorization Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Compared Models.
- Discussed Observations, Proposals, and Speculations.
