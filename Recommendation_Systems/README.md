## product_rs - Amazon Product Reviews Recommendation System
E-commerce websites like **`Amazon`**, **`Flipkart`** uses different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.

Amazon product reviews dataset for this project contains ratings of different electronic products although it does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.

- Performed Descriptive and Exploratory Data Analysis
- Built baseline recommendation system to recommend products to customers.
  - `Rank-Based` Recommendation System Model.
  - `Similarity Based` Collaborative Filtering Model.
  - `Matrix Factorization Based` Collaborative Filtering Model using `SVD`.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `user-user Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `item-item Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `Matrix Factorization Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Compared Models.
- Discussed Observations, Proposals, and Speculations

## resturant_rs - Yelp Restaurant Recommendation System
In an effort to help people find great local businesses like businesses, hairstylists, dinneres etc. The Yelp web and mobile app platforms publish crowd-sourced reviews as well as certain metadata about them that can help in customer's decision making process. 

Yelp is an automated software used to recommend the most reliable and useful reviews. Yelp has a large dataset of a collection of user reviews, business metadata, business check-ins, users' social network data, user tips for businesses across 10 cities spread across 4 countries. The original dataset is very huge hence a subset is used for computational reasons.

- Built baseline recommendation system to recommend relevant restaurants to users.
  - `Rank-Based` Recommendation System Model.
  - `Similarity Based` Collaborative Filtering Model.
  - `Matrix Factorization Based` Collaborative Filtering Model using `SVD`.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `user-user Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `item-item Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Performed hyper-parameters tuning of `Matrix Factorization Similarity based` recommendation system.
- Compared Models.
- Discussed Observations and Speculations.
