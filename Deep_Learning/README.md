## Admission Prediction
- Built a `Classification Model` using neural networks to predict an applicant's chances of admission into UCLA(University of California, Los Angeles).
- Utilized `One Hot Encoding` and scaling variable.
- Utilized optimized algorithms.
- Developed hyper-parameters.

## Employee Attrition Optimization
- Built a `Neural Network Model`.
- Built an improve `Neural Network Model by changing optimizer, tuned the decision threshold, increased layers, and configured some other hyperparameters.
- Built a `Neural Network Model` with `Batch Normalization` technique and checked for increase `F1 score`.
- Built a `Neural Network Model with `Dropout technique` and checked for reduced `False Negative rate`.
- Built a `Neural Network Model` with `Hyperparameter Optimization` techniques such as `RandomizedSearch` and `Keras Tuner` to increase `F1 score`.

# Plant Seedling Image Recognition & Classification
- Built a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model that can identify a plant seeding species at various growth stages in images.

# SVHN(Street View Housing Number) Digit Recognition
- Built a feed forward NN(Neural Network) model that can identify the digits in images.
- Built a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model that can identify the digits in images.
