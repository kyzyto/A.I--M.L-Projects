# Employee Attrition Optimization

- Built a Neural Network Model.
- Built an improve Neural Network Model by changing optimizer, tuned the decision threshold, increased layers, and configured some other hyperparameters.
- Built a Neural Network Model with Batch Normalization technique and checked for increase `F1 score`.
- Built a Neural Network Model with Dropout technique and checked for reduced `False Negative rate`.
- Built a Neural Network Model with Hyperparameter Optimization techniques such as RandomizedSearch and Keras Tuner to increase `F1 score`.

A company that is active in Big data and data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully pass some courses conducted by the company. Many people sign up for their training. The company wants to know which of these candidates want to work for the company after training or looking for new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. 

Information related to demographics, education and experience is provided by candidates during sign-up and enrollment.

This dataset is designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave their current job, and it is hence useful for HR research. By building a model that uses the current credentials, demographics, and work experience related data, you will predict the probability that a candidate is looking for a new job, as well as interpret the main factors that affect an employee's decision whether to continue or attrite. The technical focus is on need to reduce False Negatives as well as False Positives using ROC - AUC, decision threshold, etc.

Reciever Operating Characteristic - ROC
Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC

AUC - ROC is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability.
