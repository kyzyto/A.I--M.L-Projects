The world is developing rapidly and there is a continuous demand for the best knowledge and experience among people. 

Hence motivating people all around the world to stand out in their jobs and fields by pursing higher degrees that can help them in improving their skills and knowledge. As a result of that, there has been a substantial increase in the number of students applying for Master's programs.

The current admission dataset was compiled for the prediction of admissions into the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

It was built to help students in shortlisting universities based on their credentials and profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances of getting accepted.
