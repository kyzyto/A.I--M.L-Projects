Utilized Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize objects in natural scenes, which is one of the most interesting tasks in deep learning to accomplish.

The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications.

The SVHN(Street View Housing Number) dataset contains over **600,000** labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by `Google` to improve map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents. But in order to save some computation time a `.h5` file dataset is used which subset of the original dataset.
