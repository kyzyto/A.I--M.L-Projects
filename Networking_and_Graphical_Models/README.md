## enron - Enron Corp Network Analysis
Enron Corp was on of the biggest firms in USA and was delivering splendid performance  on the wall street. However, they declared bankruptcy and the Enron leadership was involved in one fo the biggest frauds and this particular fraud has been an area of interest for many **Research Scientists** and **Machine Learning Practioners**.
- Read data and understood the structure of the data.
- Put the data into a Graph.
- Identified the important nodes from the visualization
- Calculated the centrality measures and quantified the importance of;
    - `degree centrality`
    - `eigenvector centrality`
    - `closeness centrality`
    - `betweenness centrality`
- Discussed Observations and Discoveries.
## kalman - Tracking location and velocity of moving object in n-dimensional space
- **2-dimensional**<br>
  The only information available to us is the initial location (and velocity) and a series of noisy measurements of the velocity as the object moves in space. The key assumption of this problem is that the `true velocity of the object is known to be a constant`. However, the `constant velocity is not known to us`.
  -  Tracked the location (and velocity) of a moving object, e.g. a car, in a 2-dimensional space.
- **3-dimensional**<br>
  Factoring gravity to act on the ball and the intial position as well as the velocities are assumed to be known. Noisy location estimates would be used using a simulated sensor. 
  -  Tracked the location (and velocity) of a moving object, e.g. a ball, in a 3-dimensional space.
  -  Estimated the true location (and velocity) of the ball in 3D space.
