The CAVIAR project and the role of certain individuals arrested following the investigation. This investigation lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. The operation brought together investigation units of the Montreal police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada.
This project offered a rare opportunity to study a criminal network in upheaval by police forces. This allowed me to analyze changes in the network structure and to survey the reaction and adaptation of the participants while they were subjected to an increasing number of distressing constraints

-  Ran Network Analysis Algorithm
-  Generated and Visualized graphs.
-  Utilized and Visualized the centralities measures(i.e `degree`, `eigenvector`, `betweenness`, `closeness`).
-  Understand the variation of node importance across phases.
-  Documented comments and summary.
