## GoT - Game of Thrones Network Analysis
Game of Thrones is a wildly popular television series by HBO, and I intend to analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. It is important to note that if two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from on another in the books.
-  Performed Descriptive analytics.
-  Ran Network Analysis Algorithms on individual books and combined.
-  Calculated the different centralities measures(i.e `degree`,`eigenvector`, and `betweenness`) and provide inference.
-  Created Network Graphs using Plotly to visualized each book.
-  Documented a summary of observations.
-  Ran `Louvain Community` Detection and found out different groups/communities in the data.
-  Discussed finding and results.
-                 #todo - add screenshot of results.
